					"info": "<p><strong>Program Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Neubauer Collegium provides financial and administrative support for collaborative research projects that enable University of Chicago faculty to pursue complex questions that require collaboration. Project activities may involve any combination of working group meetings, conferences, performances, short-term or long-term faculty Visiting Fellows (from one month to one academic year), course instruction, research assistance, or any other relevant form of collaborative inquiry. Project activities should be designed in whatever form the applicants think best fits the nature of the questions they are asking. One of the goals of the Neubauer Collegium is to encourage experimentation in the conceptualization of collaborative work &ndash; as such, we welcome proposals that lead outside the boundaries of particular disciplines, or even challenge the nature of those boundaries themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>\n\n<p>Proposals may originate from teams of collaborators in any discipline, art, science, or administrative unit of the University of Chicago, provided humanistic knowledge and modes of inquiry are central to the pursuit, and provided University of Chicago faculty are engaged in the principal research activities. Current members of the Neubauer Collegium Faculty Advisory Board are ineligible to apply.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Award Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Neubauer Collegium proposals are solicited for the following programs:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Large-Scale Collaborative Projects: The Neubauer Collegium supports a limited number of large-scale collaborative projects each year. These can be multi-year projects (1-3 years), and may include whatever type of collaborative activities the proposing faculty deem most appropriate to the questions they are pursuing. Requests for support may range from $25,000/year-$100,000/year over the duration of the project (up to $300,000 total for a three-year project).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Seed Projects: The Neubauer Collegium supports seed projects for faculty teams wishing to explore collaborative topics at a stage not sufficiently developed for a large-scale award. Seed Projects may be multi-year (1-3 years), and may include whatever type of collaborative activities the proposing faculty deem most appropriate to the questions they are pursuing. Requests for support are accepted for up to $25,000/year over the duration of the project (up to $75,000 total for a three-year project).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Visiting Fellows: The Neubauer Collegium can host Visiting Fellows who are not otherwise affiliated with a large-scale or seed project. Nominations for such visitors may be put forward by any individual or group of faculty, and should describe how the Visiting Fellow will catalyze or strengthen collaborative research communities on campus. Although Visiting Fellows may be asked to offer a course, their campus residency is intended to stimulate collaborative research, not to provide curricular coverage. We welcome proposals that include a sabbatical top-off for the visitor while on leave from her/his home institution.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>Prospective applicants should download the Neubauer Collegium&nbsp;<a href=\"http://neubauercollegium.uchicago.edu/cfp/guidelines/\" target=\"_blank\">Application Guidelines</a>&nbsp;and are invited to consult with staff at the Neubauer Collegium (<a href=\"mailto:collegium@uchicago.edu\">collegium@uchicago.edu</a>).</em></p>\n",
